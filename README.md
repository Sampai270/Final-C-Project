# Final-C-Project by Vitamin C++
Welcome to the repository of our group! This repo will consist of our makefile, the readme file, and acutal C file for our Rock, Paper Scissors code. The game is a best out of 3 with player versus computer style. The computer's input is randomized and all results of the game is dependent on the user's input. Draws count as no score and first to 2 round wins win it all! Good luck playing this game and hopefully you enjoy our code! Evan Lutchmidat and Samuel Hui from CS 102-B.
